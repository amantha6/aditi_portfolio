# Developer Portfolio

A clean, responsive, and tech-focused portfolio template built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Clone or Download** this repository.
2.  **Open `index.html`** in your browser to view the site.
3.  **Edit `index.html`** to update your content (About, Experience, Projects).

## 🛠 Customization

-   **Colors**: Open `style.css` and modify the variables in the `:root` section (top of the file) to change the color scheme.
-   **Images**: Add your images to an `assets` folder (you'll need to create one) and update the `src` attributes in `index.html`. Currently, placeholders are used.
-   **Icons**: We use FontAwesome 6.4.0 (CDN linked in `index.html`).

## 📦 Hosting on GitHub Pages

1.  Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `my-portfolio`).
2.  Upload these files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `README.md`) to the repository.
3.  Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
4.  Under **Source**, select `main` (or `master`) branch.
5.  Click **Save**.
6.  Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/my-portfolio/`.

## 📄 Sections

-   **Hero**: Introduction and resume download (link your PDF).
-   **About**: Bio and bio image.
-   **Experience**: Tabbed interface for work history.
-   **Projects**: Featured projects (large cards) and other projects (grid).
-   **Contact**: Simple call to action.
